# Two EAPS Ring example GNS3 project

This GNS3 project was made to show a configuration example of how Two EAPS rings connected together with CFM is configured.  Vlan Data is across all switches and CFM is used with EAPS to protect against logical failures.

Note: This project was built with the EXOS-VM_v21.1.1.4-disk1.qcow2 image.  Make sure you the image is loaded into GNS3.
