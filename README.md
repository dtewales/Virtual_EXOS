# Virtual EXOS Images
Virtual EXOS images are provided to be used in virtualized environments such as VirtualBox or VMware.

Please reference the Install Guides to create a virtual machine from the ISOs in this folder.  The .xos files are provided to allow you to upgrade an existing installation.

### Feature and Functionality Note
Virtual EXOS installations are not officially supported by GTAC and not all features and functions are implemented. For example, VXLAN VTEP and VPLS/VPWS PE functions are configurable but the associated data planes are not provided in Virtual EXOS.
